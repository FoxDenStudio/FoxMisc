# FoxMisc [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FoxDenStudio/FoxMisc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FoxDenStudio/FoxMisc)
A Random plugin for [SpongeAPI](https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeAPI).
Requires [FoxCore](https://github.com/FoxDenStudio/FoxCore).
I made this because I was bored and wanted to make it rain health potions and cats.

## Building from source
